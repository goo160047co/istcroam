Chapter 1: Installation
To install intermaps roam, follow the link to your county install. The Idaho State Tax Commission should have provided this link to your county.
This file should be in a zipped format and could be large. You will want to unzip it and place at the root of the C:\ drive.  In the C:\field folder there should be an application called Roam.
You will want to place a short cut to that on the user’s desktop.
To do this right click on Roam in C:\Field then navigate down to send to the Desktop (create shortcut).
On your desktop, click on the Roam and you should see the mapping application.  

To connect the GPS:
If your tablet/laptop has integrated GPS unit.
In Roam, click on settings on the left hand side of the application. In the settings tab locate the  GPS section and locate connect via scan click the refresh list. The port of the GPS should show up. Make sure the three(3) boxes below Connect via are checked. Cross check this by going into the going to map. In the map on the right top of the screen click the “Enable GPS”. Make sure that you are outside. If the Enable GPS turns green your map should zoom to the area where you are located.

If your table does not have an integrated GPS and you are using USB or Bluetooth GPS unit. You will need to setup a virtual GPS port which turns the GPS signal into a COM signal that the map can read.  
You will want to make sure that the tablet has Bluetooth capabilities.  First turn them on. On windows 8 or 10 tablets should be in the settings section of the tablet.  Next you will want to install a virtual GPS splitter port program.  There are many free ones out there; I use the free Franson GPS Gate installation. http://update.gpsgate.com/install/GpsGateClient.exe
Install the GPSGate Client. Once installed right click on the GPSGate(probably red icon) on desktop tray down by the clock.  Click on settings. A Franson GPSGate settings dialog box should open up with three(3) tabs, Input, Output and Advanced. For the input make sure that the Bluetooth is selected. On the output tab for the Add output – to where GPS data is sent select virtual COM port 10 then click the Add button. On the Advanced tab under the options group select Start GPSGate after boot and also check the Share settings for all user account.  Close out of the setting box by clicking the X on top right corner. 

Close out and reenter Roam if you are still in it. Click on the setting on right hand side then down to GPS group then click the refresh list and look for COM10.  Click on the projects on left hand side, locate your project then click the enable GPS icon on top right.
  
It should list connecting…. And turn grey, if the GPS fails it will turn red,  if it is green you should be good to go.

If this is the case go back into your virtual port splitter and change the virtual COM port to another one.  Then redo this process above with closing out and reentering roam.  If it connects it should turn green then your map should point to the right location.  Your GPS should be connected to the ROAM application.

 
Chapter 2: How to use the map.
1.	To open the map click on the Roam application that is on your desktop. It should look similar to this:
 
If it is not on your desktop you can locate the Roam application in the folder at c:\field
Once in the map several projects might be available depending on your county. 
Click on the application card that you are using. In some counties there might be residential and commercial other might just have one. The projects section looks like this: 
 
The map section looks like this:
 
 
On the map there are several buttons that you will use.  On the left Legend shows the legend for the items on the map. In the search in most counties you can search by parcel number, name and address. You do not have to be connected to a GPS to do this. 
 
 In some counties we have setup a sync routine with the TSB dashboard.  The status of the sync should be show on the right hand side of the dialog.
 

If you click on sync you might see upload and download buttons. You will have to be connected to wifi in order for this to work. 

On the top of the application, you have the home to go back to the projects section, the button  to toggle the imagery, the pan to move the map, zoom in and zoom out to zoom in and out of the map, on touch screen devices you should be able to pinch and zoom and the select button where you can select the parcel to get more information.  And the GPS connect button, you can click hit this to turn on and off the GPS unit. For example if you are traveling a car and do not want the GPS to follow you can push this button to turn it off temporally from the map.
 
 
Chapter 3 Editing the Data.
Editing of the data/database is only available in some counties.  
If you can edit the data, click on the parcel that you want to edit using the select tool. The parcel should turn purple and there should be a list of items that pull up on the right side of the map.  These refer to the appraisal paper cards. Locate the item during your appraisal and locate that card in the application.  You should be able to edit the data that is in that form. You will need to use wifi or your data enabled tablet to sync the data back to the database after completed for the day.
